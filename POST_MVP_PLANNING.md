# Agent1 - Post-MVP Planning

## List of Deferred Features and Enhancements

Based on the MVP completion and requirements analysis, the following features and enhancements were identified as deferred from the initial scope:

1. **Support for Different Text Outputs**
   - Ability to customize the text output beyond "Hello World"
   - Support for various text formats and styles

2. **Configurable Iteration Counts**
   - Allow users to configure the number of iterations through command-line arguments
   - Provide a way to set custom iteration limits

3. **Add Logging Capabilities**
   - Implement logging for debugging and monitoring purposes
   - Support for different log levels (info, debug, error)

4. **Provide More Sophisticated Error Reporting**
   - Enhanced error messages with context information
   - Better handling of edge cases and error scenarios

5. **Include Unit Tests for Enhanced Reliability**
   - Comprehensive test suite covering all functionality
   - Integration tests for complex scenarios

## Prioritized Feature Roadmap

## Summary

This post-MVP planning document outlines the deferred features that could enhance the Agent1 application in future development cycles. These features were not included in the initial MVP due to scope limitations but represent valuable additions that would improve the application's functionality and usability.

The prioritization considers both technical complexity and user value. The implementation of these features would require careful consideration of the existing architecture to maintain backward compatibility while extending functionality.
